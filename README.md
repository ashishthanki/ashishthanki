My name is **Ashish**, and I am a data scientist based in London!

ðŸ’› I love using data to aid in decision making by using data science tools and machine learning to solve problems. I am a self taught data scientist and contribute to the open source data science community. I share my code on Github, write blogs and spend a lot of my time outside of work learning about data science - it is a hobby!
